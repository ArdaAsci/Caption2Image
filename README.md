# Caption2Image
This Project was developed as the term project for EEE543 Neural Networks in Bilkent University Electrical and Electronics Engineering M.S. program.  


**NOTE**: The repo itself was not built to be useful for a 3<sup>rd</sup> party. However, you are welcome to experiment with the code.

## Training
The model has been trained with the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset using the ideas from [GLIDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10741) and [DALLÂ·E 2](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-2.pdf). Both of these papers employ [Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233) for their training, which this project does not support. 

## Data
You can find some useful preprocessed data in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gw4j5XpmVWs2Z5xzixmuullZ6VdrBJ6r). The descriptions for each of the files can be found in the data/ folder of this repo.
